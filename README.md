# Filter

`Filter` is a plugin allowing players to filter the ground items 
they'd like to pick up.

This project was written as a sample project and will require
modification for use on production servers. It does not currently
support multiple pages of materials and has no permissions.

# Usage

Install the plugin on a 1.13+ server and execute the command 
`/itemfilter` for usage.
